# 🌾 AgriLedger: Crop-to-Consumer Traceability

## 📘 Project Description
AgriLedger is a blockchain-powered traceability system designed to track the journey of agricultural produce from the **farm** to the **consumer**. It ensures **transparency**, **trust**, and **authenticity** by recording every stage of a crop’s life cycle on an immutable ledger.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To revolutionize agricultural supply chains by providing **end-to-end traceability**, enabling **farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers** to verify the origin, ownership, and movement of crops with complete transparency.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Batch Registration:** Farmers can record crop batches with details like type, origin, and harvest date.  
- **Ownership Transfer:** Seamless trace of product ownership across distributors, transporters, and retailers.  
- **Real-time Status Updates:** Updates on every stage — harvested, in transit, delivered.  
- **Immutable Records:** Every transaction is permanently stored on the blockchain.  
- **Consumer Verification:** Customers can view product authenticity and source.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **IoT sensors** for automatic data capture (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
- **QR code scanning** for consumers to access full trace history.  
- Incorporation of **smart payments** and **carbon footprint tracking**.  
- Use of **AI analytics** for supply chain optimization.
